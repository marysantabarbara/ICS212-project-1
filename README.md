# ICS212-project-1

This was the first project I have made with C. Even though it is still a beginner level program, I am still proud of it. I worked long hours trying to make this code and actually really liked how it turned out. 

This program will hold a database for user accounts and display a menu to offer choices for the user of how to interact with accounts inside of the database. Each account will have the informatio of the user's name, account number, address, and year of birth. The database is structured in a linked list and is sorted numerically by the account number.
